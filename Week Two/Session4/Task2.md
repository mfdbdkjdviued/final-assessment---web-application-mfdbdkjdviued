##  Question 2 Answers
Public cloud service providers need to comply with industry regulations, but large companies (such as the financial and insurance industries) cannot store important data on public networks in order to take into account industry and customer privacy, so they tend to set up private cloud networks.
The operation of private cloud is similar to that of public cloud. However, setting up a private cloud is a major investment. Enterprises need to design their own data centers, networks, and storage equipment, and have a professional consultant team. Enterprise management must fully consider the necessity of using private clouds and whether they have sufficient resources to ensure the normal operation of private clouds.
